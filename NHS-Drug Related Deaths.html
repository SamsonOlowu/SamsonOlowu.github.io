								<h3>Project Summary</h3>
								<p>In this project, I conducted an analysis of drug-related deaths in Scotland using the dataset from the NHS website. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of Power BI, I explored and visualized various aspects of the data to gain insights into the prevalence and patterns of drug-related fatalities in the region. </p>
								<h3>Tools</h3>
								<p>Power BI <br>DAX <br>Flaticon <br>Synoptic Panel  </p>
								<h3>Insights</h3>
								<p>- <b>Greater Glasgow & Clyde</b> had the highest number of deaths, with a total of <b>2,006</b> fatalities. 
									<br>- From <b>2009 to 2018</b>, there was an <b>overall increase</b> in the number of deaths, except in <b>Ayrshire & Arran</b>, where the number of deaths remained at 0 both in 2009 and 2018.
									<br>- </b>May and Sunday</b> had the highest number of deaths, with <b>580 and 1,028 deaths</b>, respectively.
									<br>- <b>Opioids</b> were the leading cause of death for both males and females. The age group <b>35-44</b> experienced the highest number of deaths for both genders.
									<br>- The most common substances found during post mortems were <b>alcohol, anti-depressants, etizolam, diazepam, heroin/morphine, and methadone</b>.
									
									</p>
									<h3>Limitation</h3>
								<p>The limitation of the analysis is that the sheets in the database were mostly linked by year, which restricted the ability to conduct further drilldown analysis for the report. This means that it was challenging to explore more detailed insights and correlations beyond the yearly data due to the lack of granular connections between different sheets in the database. As a result, certain aspects and trends related to drug-related deaths might not have been fully explored or understood, potentially limiting the depth of the insights presented in the report. </p>
								<h3>Data Source</h3>
								<p>Drug-Related Death dataset can be found at <a href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/national-drug-related-death-database-scotland/the-national-drug-related-deaths-database-scotland-report-analysis-of-deaths-occurring-in-2017-and-2018/" target="_blank"> <b>Public Health Scotland</b></a></h1> </p>
